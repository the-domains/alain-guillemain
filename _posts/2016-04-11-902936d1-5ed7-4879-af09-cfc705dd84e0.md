I am presently completing Honours in Philosophy at the[University of Queensland][0], for which I am writing two theses.

My first thesis,[**_An Ethics of Freedom_**][1], proposes a system of ethics that is grounded in freedom, as opposed to duty, happiness or non-harm. The thesis is available for[download as a pdf][1].

My second thesis will explore the 'miracle of applied mathematics', the question of why it is that mathematics developed in isolation from physical phenomena just so happens to accurately describe physical phenomena. The thesis will be uploaded in Nov 2015\.
